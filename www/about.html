                        <p>Founded in 1945 as a steel trading company, we entered automotive manufacturing in 1947 to bring the iconic Willys Jeep onto Indian roads.  Over the years, we’ve diversified into many new businesses in order to better meet the needs of our customers.  We follow a unique business model of creating empowered companies that enjoy the best of entrepreneurial independence and Group-wide synergies.  This principle has led our growth into a US $16.7 billion multinational group with more than 180,000 employees in over 100 countries across the globe.</p>
                        <p>Today, our operations span 18 key industries that form the foundation of every modern economy: aerospace, aftermarket, agribusiness, automotive, components, construction equipment, consulting services, defense, energy, farm equipment, finance and insurance, industrial equipment, information technology, leisure and hospitality, logistics, real estate, retail, and two wheelers.</p>
                        <p>Our federated structure enables each business to chart its own future and simultaneously leverage synergies across the entire Group’s competencies. In this way, the diversity of our expertise allows us to bring our customers the best in many fields.</p>
